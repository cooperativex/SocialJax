 # Coins

 Two players collect coins in a shared room, where each coin is assigned to one player's color. Each coin, upon appearing, has an equal 50% probability of being assigned to the first player's color or the second player's color. An agent receives a reward of 1 for collecting any coin, regardless of its color. If one player collects a coin assigned to the other playerâ€™s color, the other player receives a reward of -2.
