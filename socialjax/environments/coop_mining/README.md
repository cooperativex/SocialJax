# Coop Mining

In this environment, two types of ore spawn randomly in empty spaces. Players can extract the ore to get reward. Iron ore (gray) can be mined individually and provides a reward of +1 upon extraction. In contrast, gold ore (yellow) requires coordinated mining by two to four players within a 3-step window, granting a reward of +8 to each participant. When a player begins to mine gold ore, the state of the ore changes to 'partially mined' to indicate readiness for another player to assist. Visually, this is represented by a brighter shade of yellow. If no other player cooperates or too many players attempt to mine simultaneously, the ore reverts to its original state, and no reward is granted.
